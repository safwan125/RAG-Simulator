# RAG-Simulator
🧠 RAG-Simulator — Resource Allocation Graph Visualizer
RAG-Simulator is a web-based interactive tool designed to help students, educators, and OS enthusiasts visualize Resource Allocation Graphs (RAGs). It allows users to simulate process-resource interactions, understand deadlock scenarios, and explore how resource requests and assignments can affect system safety.

🔍 Key Features
🟢 Add Processes and Resources as graph nodes

🔁 Create Request (P → R) and Allocation (R → P) edges

⚠️ Deadlock Detection using cycle detection algorithms

📉 Graphical UI powered by React Flow for easy interaction

💡 Visual cues for safe, unsafe, and deadlocked states

💾 Save/load graph state (optional feature)

🛠️ Built With
React / Next.js

React Flow (for visual graph manipulation)

🎯 Ideal For
Operating Systems learners

Teachers and educators

Visual explanation in classroom or presentations

Debugging deadlocks in process-resource systems
